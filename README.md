# Global Billionaire Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective:
Major objective of the study is to Analyze for trends and patterns among the world's billionaires to uncover insights into their wealth accumulation, industries of dominance, geographic distribution, and economic factors influencing their success.

## Findings and Insights ðŸ”ŽðŸ“Š
1. **Wealth and Industry**
   * **Dominant Industries**: The leading industries among billionaires are Finance & Investment, Technology, and Fashion & Retail. This suggests that industries with high innovation potential (like technology) and those deeply tied to global markets (like finance) offer extensive opportunities for wealth creation. In contrast, sectors like Telecom, Construction, Sports, and Gambling are less represented, possibly due to their slower growth rates or higher regulatory barriers.
